# CEP Validation Form Using The ViaCEP API

<p>
This is a project that was developed using HTML, JS and CSS. 
It's a simple project also done in my technical course where the specific zip code entered is validated.

Feel free to send questions, criticisms and suggestions, if you have any ideas to improve the code you are welcome!
